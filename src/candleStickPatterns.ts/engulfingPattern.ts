 * Engulfing Pattern
 * - two candle stick pattern
 * - green candle appears after downtrend and it completely consumes body of red candle before it, indicates bullish engulfing reversal
 * - red candle appears after uptrend and it completely consumes body of green candle before it, indicates bearish engulfing reversal
 * - wicks need not be engulfed, but below code will engulf the wicks as well in the body
